# Sunday Open Draw

## Round Robin (13 weeks)
The season starts with Round Robin play so each team gets a chance to play every team at least once.


## Weighted Round Robin (4 weeks)
Games will continue with the game results (wins/losses) added to the results from the regular round robin. Teams will find themselves primarily matched up against teams from either the top or the bottom based on how they finished in the round robin.


## Playoff Round (4 weeks)
The Sunday Open uses a single elimination tournament format; however, all teams keep playing even after a loss.


# Website / Standings
* The Sunday Open has its own website at http://vccsundayopen.club
* The Schedule with results and League Standings should be updated in a timely fashion


# Sunday Open General Rules
* We must be off the ice by 8:45 - the bell is just a reminder.
* Games that are tied at the end of regulation remain ties.
* Spares can play any position but can't throw last stones (they can call game).
* You must have 2 members of your team playing to register a win
* You register 3 points for a Win, 1 points for a Loss, 2 points for a Tie, 0 points for a Default

 
# Sunday Open Clock Policy
We have 2 hours of contracted time from the Club and we are to be off the ice at the end of those two hours.  As such, the clock rule that we use in the Sunday Open, is that we should try and honour our two hour time-commitment on the ice.

Procedurally *the skips should discuss amongst themselves how many more ends they will have after the 5th end* (will they have time for 1 or 2). As a more competitive league we acknowledge that you need to know how many more ends you are playing as it affects how you will call the last ends in a close game.

If two are decided on then they should play those two and play responsibly (at a proper pace). If you go over a small amount over time to get the second end in then it's ok as long as you aren’t making a habit of it (we are talking a few (up to 5) minutes (should try and be in the skip stones when clock goes off)). No one curls after us on Sunday so we have more leeway than most Leagues, but officially we do not have permission to go over time.


# Default Rule
It is the responsibility of the defaulting team to contact the members of the opposition to let them know they will not be in attendance. The Team Reps have a contact list for all League Members so they can track the opposition down. If a member of the opposition shows up then a default will be registered.

If enough notice is provided (minimum 24 hours by phone, 48 hours by email), then a loss will be given.

It is recommended that the defaulting team buys a pitcher of beer for their opposition when next they play to recognize the value of the ice
time lost.

If a team defaults 2 or more times in a season they may not be asked to return the following season.


# Spares
Spares must be VCC members. Your Team Captain has access to a list of members that have expressed interest in sparing for Sunday Open. Please give as much advanced notice as possible. Ultimately you, and your team, are responsible for making sure that you have enough players for the game.


# Tie Breakers for Playoff Seeding
* If a Team has defaults they lose any tie breaker
* Direct Head-to-Head if possible
* Most wins (if two teams have same number of points but one has more wins than the other teams (team has same number of points though because of more ties than losses) the team with more wins finishes ahead).
* Comparison of how they perform versus the top team in the standings (working down the standings list until the tie is broken).
* Coin flip.
* Everyone makes the playoffs.

 
# Playoff Rules
* The higher seeded team gets the choice of hammer and stones.
* Spares must play one of the front-end positions (lead or second).
* You must have 2 members of your team playing to register a win.
* No ties … draw to the button … only throwing team may sweep … must have a piece of the rings to register the win.
* For the Championship Final Game, if both teams agree to play on a different sheet, they have the right to switch ice with any other game as long as they inform that sheet before the teams enter the ice.

 
# VCC Club Championships
The winner of the Sunday Open Playoffs will be offered our spot in the VCC Club Championship. If the Sunday Open is granted an additional spot / or if the winner is not available to play the spot will be awarded based on the final standings in the playoffs.
