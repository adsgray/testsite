## League Background

The Sunday Open League will be entering its 20th year. We are an open
league where more than half of the teams are mixed gender. Most teams
in the Sunday Open have been part of the league for multiple years, but
it is a friendly league and welcomes new teams whenever we can. The Sunday
Open League is one of the most active in the club, with many of its members
participating on the VCC Board, playing in multiple leagues, and competing
in the VCC bonspiels.
