## League Background

The Sunday Open will be entering its 18th year. The Sunday Open is one
of the more competitive leagues in the club as most teams there have
been part of the league for 8+ years, but it is a friendly league as
we all grew out of the novice program together. It is a very loyal
league with a high retention rate. The Sunday Open is one of the most
active in the club as many of its members participate on the VCC
Board, play in multiple leagues, and compete in the VCC bonspiels.
