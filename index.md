## Important Dates
* February 20, 2022 - Family Day weekend, no games
* March 6, 2022 - Playoffs begin! Everyone qualifies to League playoffs (please note that the playoffs do not fall under the Province's tournament restrictions because they are held in a manner consistent with normal League play). Because we have only 14 teams in the League, the top 2 ranked teams will have byes this week - but with the opportunity to play an exhibition game against each other if desired.

## 2021 - 2022 Season
The season is under way! Please e-mail [info@vccsundayopen.club](mailto:info@vccsundayopen.club) with any questions about sparing or bringing a team for next season.

## League Background

The Sunday Open League is in its 20th year. We are an open
league where more than half of the teams are mixed gender. Most teams
in the Sunday Open have been part of the league for multiple years, but
it is a friendly league and welcomes new teams whenever we can. The Sunday
Open League is one of the most active in the club, with many of its members
participating on the VCC Board, playing in multiple leagues, and competing
in the VCC bonspiels.
